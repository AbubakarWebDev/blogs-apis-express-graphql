# Blogs Management System using GraphQL, Express, and TypeScript

In this repository, we use the **Express library** in **Node.js** as the backend framework to handle HTTP requests. It serves as the foundation for integrating **Apollo GraphQL**, a tool for building GraphQL APIs. Apollo allows us to define a schema and resolvers to efficiently fetch and manage **user data** and **blog data**. By combining Express and Apollo GraphQL, we create a scalable and structured system for data retrieval and interaction. This setup ensures a seamless flow of information between the client and server.
